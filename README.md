Although the emotion classification task was explored primarily as a technological study, it was not formally taken up as a project, and hence the required resources for model building were not provisioned. Despite this, the investigation highlighted several promising opportunities for real-world application. For instance, lightweight emotion detection models could be applied to internal call recordings or customer interaction audio—ensuring full consent and anonymization—to enhance sentiment analysis tools and drive more personalized services. Further exploration of this idea would require cross-functional collaboration, feasibility assessment, and resource planning aligned with organizational goals.
