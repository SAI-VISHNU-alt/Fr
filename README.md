1.3.1 SECURITY-COMPLIANT DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Operating within a highly regulated enterprise environment required strict adherence to internal security and compliance frameworks. All development efforts were governed by the organizationâ€™s IT security principles, which mandated that any tools, models, or libraries used must undergo appropriate validation and approval. Specifically, downloading external resources or integrating third-party frameworks necessitated prior clearance from the IT security team. This ensured that the integrity of the internal systems was maintained at all times. Consequently, model experimentation and workflow design were carefully structured to remain within the scope of permitted tools, emphasizing robust planning, secure data handling, and the use of approved open-source technologies in accordance with organizational policies.
