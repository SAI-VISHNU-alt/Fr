Subject: Request for Approval of Internship Report

Dear Barani,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to kindly request your approval for my internship report, which I am submitting as part of the course completion requirements. I have documented the work and contributions made during the internship period, and I have ensured that all necessary details are included.

I have attached the report for your review. Please let me know if any modifications are required. Once approved, I will proceed with the submission in the portal.
