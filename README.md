The internship provided a meaningful platform to apply data-driven approaches to practical problems, particularly in the area of speech-based emotion classification. I explored various pre-trained models available on Hugging Face, assessing their suitability for language-agnostic emotion detection tasks. As part of this effort, I designed and documented a detailed methodology outlining data preprocessing steps, model evaluation strategies, and performance comparison criteria. The process helped me strengthen my understanding of model selection, fine-tuning, and evaluation using tools like Python and Jupyter Lab, while aligning my work with the projectâ€™s overall objectives through regular reviews and feedback sessions.
