As part of an advanced learning initiative in speech-based AI classification, we conducted an in-depth study on the development of a Language-Agnostic Emotion Classification model. Instead of implementing the full training pipeline due to infrastructure limitations, our focus shifted toward understanding and documenting the methodologies required to achieve such a task. We thoroughly explored publicly available multilingual speech emotion datasets and surveyed existing open-source models available on platforms like Hugging Face. Our work included a detailed analysis of preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods (such as MFCC and spectrograms), and model architectures commonly used in emotion recognition from speech, including CNNs, RNNs, and transformer-based models. The outcome was a comprehensive technical documentation outlining the step-by-step process to build and evaluate a language-independent emotion classification system, which can serve as a practical guide for future implementations or research extensions.
